# Splut! Board Game

## Introduction

Welcome to Splut!, an exciting and strategic board game for two to four players. In Splut!, players control unique characters like Stonetrolls, Dwarves, and Sorcerers on a diamond-shaped board. The goal is simple: eliminate all opposing Sorcerers by cleverly moving your pieces and strategically using Rocks.

## Components

- **Game Board:** A diamond-shaped board with squares.
- **Players:** Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow, each with a Stonetroll, a Dwarf, and a Sorcerer.
- **Special Pieces:** Rocks.

## Game Objective

The objective of Splut! is to eliminate all opposing Sorcerers by landing a Rock on their heads. When a Sorcerer is eliminated, the entire team is removed from the board.

## Gameplay

- Players take turns, with each player making 3 steps per turn.
- The first player makes 1 step on their first turn, and the second player makes 2 steps on their first turn.
- Steps involve moving one of your pieces to an adjacent square horizontally or vertically.

### Stonetroll Moves

- **Pulling a Rock:** Stonetrolls can pull Rocks from squares right behind them.
- **Throwing a Rock:** Stonetrolls can throw Rocks horizontally or vertically. Rocks continue until they hit an obstacle (board edge, Stonetroll, Sorcerer, or another Rock). If a Sorcerer is hit, the corresponding team is eliminated.

### Dwarf Moves

- **Pushing Pieces:** Dwarves can push consecutive pieces (including Rocks) in a straight line. All pushed pieces move one square in the direction of the Dwarf's movement.

### Sorcerer Moves

- **Levitating Rocks:** Sorcerers can levitate stationary Rocks to an empty square in the same direction as their movement. Levitation is optional but continuous during a turn.
